# CS-210-Project-One
This is the first project from SNHU's CS-210 Project One Assignment.

This project was to create a program that displays a digital clock to the user. The user should be able to add minutes, hours, and seconds in both 12-hour and 24-hour format. This was also able to update and clear screen every second for the user. I feel for this project I created good and readable code that was not too cluttered and utilized appropriate whitespace and comments. I could probably enhance the code to create more smooth flowing outputs and make the clock run and read better than it currently does. I found the hardest parts to code were the clear and update functionalities, as I had to teach myself these functions through online research. These functionalities however may prove to be beneficial for me moving forward in the coding world. I made this program maintanable, readable, and adaptable with proper whitespace and lack of clutter that makes the code easy to read and understand, so in the case of debugging, it should be easy to find where the errors are.
